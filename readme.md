# VPN Client-Server Communication System with Flask and Cryptography

## Overview

This project implements a secure, encrypted communication system using Flask as a client-side interface and a Python-based VPN server. It provides a web-based solution for securely exchanging encrypted messages over a VPN. Using **Fernet encryption** from the `cryptography` library, this project ensures that data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted and secure.

## Features

- **Secure Communication**: Utilizes Fernet encryption to ensure that messages between the client and server remain private.
- **Automated Key Management**: The server generates and stores an encryption key at startup, which is used by the client for encryption/decryption.
- **Web-Based Client Interface**: A clean and user-friendly HTML and CSS interface where users can send and receive encrypted messages.
- **Automatic IP Handling**: The client retrieves the server's IP automatically, making setup simpler.
- **Socket Programming**: TCP sockets are used for communication between the client and server.

## File Structure

This project consists of the following components:

- `app.py`: The Flask application serving as the client interface.
- `vpn_server.py`: The server application handling encryption, decryption, and client-server communication.
- `vpn_key.key`: The encryption key file, generated by the server on startup.
- `templates/index.html`: HTML template for the client interface.
- `static/style.css`: CSS file for styling the client interface.

## How It Works

1. **VPN Server Initialization**:
   - The VPN server (`vpn_server.py`) generates a Fernet encryption key and saves it to `vpn_key.key`.
   - It listens on a specified port (default is 8080) for incoming connections from the client.

2. **Client-Server Communication**:
   - The Flask client (`app.py`) reads the encryption key from `vpn_key.key` to ensure it’s consistent with the server’s key.
   - When a message is submitted in the web interface, it is encrypted and sent to the VPN server over a TCP socket.
   - The VPN server decrypts the message, processes it, encrypts a response, and sends it back to the client.
   - The client then decrypts the response and displays it on the webpage.

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
2. **Run the VPN Server:**
    In one terminal, start the server with:
    ```bash
    python vpn_server.py
3. **Run the Flask Client:**
    In another terminal, start the Flask app:
    ```bash
    python app.py
4. **Run the Flask Client:**
    In another terminal, start the Flask app:
    Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` to use the client interface.

## Usage
- **Sending a Message:** Enter a message in the web interface and click "Send". The message will be encrypted and sent to the VPN server.
- **Receive a Response:** The server processes the message, encrypts a response, and sends it back. The client decrypts and displays it.

## Dependencies
- `Flask` - For creating the web interface.
- `cryptography` - For encryption/decryption with Fernet.
- `socket` - For TCP connections.

## Future Enhancements
- **Multi-Client Support:** Enable handling of multiple clients.
- **Key Rotation:** Implement regular encryption key updates.
- **File Transfer:** Add secure file transfer functionality.
